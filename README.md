Greetings fellow programmer ! 
The file you are about to see contains a code written in the programming language Python , and was made during my years in high school 

What does it do? 
The VMP (Vehicle Managment Program) is a virtual garage , where the user can register vehicles of any type (planes , cars , ships) and later on view. 
All information (Data) is saved in a .txt file that is being created at the same folder you save the .py file. 

NOTE ! You must not change the name of the .txt file once its created. Doing so will result to the program creating a new .txt file each time it has to register new data 
You must ensure that the .txt file and the .py file are in the same folder. 
You must not change the content of the .txt file to ensure it runs smoothly , and will not create any sort of errors. 
You are allowed to take the program and change it as you please , but if you wish to upload it anywhere please do mention that you used this repository , it helps me alot you know !!
